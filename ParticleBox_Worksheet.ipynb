    "For the first task, we will consider the hypothesis that for all the molecules in the experiment, the electrons in $\\pi$ orbitals behave as free electrons in a one-dimensional box. The energy levels of particles in a box only depend on basic physical constants and the length of the box $L$ according to the formula $E_n=\\frac{h^2n^2}{8mL}$, where $n$ is a quantum number that identifies the step in the ladder of single-electron states. The absorption maximum will correspond to the highest occupied state being excited to the lowest unoccupied state. For a system with $N$ $\\pi$ electrons, the difference in energy between the two states is $\\Delta E = \\frac{h^2}{8mL}(N+1)$, which corresponds to an absorption wavelength of $\\lambda^{FE}=\\frac{8mc}{h}\\frac{L^2}{N+1}$. For the conjugated systems in our experiments, the number of electrons is $N=p+3$ and the length of the box can be assumed to be $L=(p+3)l$, where $p$ is the number of carbon atoms in between the two nitrogens, while $l=0.139$ nm is the typical C-C bond length in aromatic systems. Accounting for all the constants, the free electrons (particle in a box) prediction for the absorption maximum is $\\lambda^{FE}(\\textrm{in nm})=63.7\\frac{(p+3)^2}{p+4}$.\n",

    "The model described above is clearly simplified. We could try to improve it by including the effect of the aromatic rings on the potential of the box. For example, we could assume that the presence of the aromatic rings soften the box, so that the effective lenght is a bit larger than the one used above. This could be achieved by introducing an empirical parameter $\\alpha$ in the equation, as follows $\\lambda^{FE}(\\textrm{in nm})=63.7\\frac{(p+3+\\alpha)^2}{p+4}$.\n",
